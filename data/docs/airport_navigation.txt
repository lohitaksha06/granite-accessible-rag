Airport navigation assistance (general kiosk guidance)

- After arriving, check the nearest display for your flight number and gate.
- If you have not checked in, use the airline counter or self check-in kiosk.
- Follow signs for “Security” to reach the screening area.
- Keep your ID and boarding pass ready before the checkpoint.
- At security, place metal items and electronics into trays if asked.
- After security, check the displays again because gates can change.
- Follow the concourse signs to your gate number.
- If you need help, ask at an information desk or help point.
- If you are lost, share your current landmark (shop name, restroom, gate number).
- For accessibility services, request wheelchair or assistance at airline support.
